# Installation
If you want to get this running be sure to have a ComputerCraft emulator such as <a href="http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/18789-ccemuredux-computercraft-emulator-redux/">CCEmuRedux</a> or <a href="https://emux.cc/">CCEmuX</a>. But if you want to run this in minecraft be sure to have CC-Tweaked.
